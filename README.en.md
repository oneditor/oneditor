# One Editor
[Demo Link](https://oneditor.github.io/oneditor/?id=1)

## It is a poster editor, but not limited to that.
* It is a lightweight Photoshop, but more convenient. It supports importing PS files and achieves a restoration rate of 95% (some masks are not supported).
* It supports editing of text, images, SVG, backgrounds, and multiple pages, and supports exporting to various formats such as PNG, JPEG, and PDF.
* It provides a large number of free templates, elements, photography, backgrounds, fonts and other materials, and also integrates AI-generated materials.
* Video, animation, and richer components will be added soon, and the goal is to create a super editor that integrates images, GIFs, videos, PPT, and H5.
